    <h1>Who / What we are</h1>
    <p>We are 3 people hoping to pass this course</p>
    <p>To do that, we need to make a VUE website</p>
    <p>
        And to that website, we need to add an About Us page, this is the
        aforementioned page
    </p>
    <p>I sincerely hope that this is sufficient</p>
